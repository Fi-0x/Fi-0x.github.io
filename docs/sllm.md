### Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart
- Study must be immersive. The average lasting time for a normal person is about 25-30 min. So after you study about 25 or 30 min, stop to take a break. This process will refresh you with energy and greatly help you boost your efficiency.
  After a time of training, you can just study longer and longer for about 1h.
  High-class people must have a good command of this span of concentration. 
- Don't study in the living room, bedroom, etc. Study in a separate place dedicated to studying. Or you can set a particular mode/lamp during your study.
- When planning your day, it is important to plan your studying time ahead of the recreational time.
- Don't try to memorize without understanding. Try to understand the concept first. Then the facts. Cause facts can be easily searched on the Internet. With a process of addressing, you will memorize the content more easily. The key is to say that the content you absorb must be meaningful. You can just relate it to your previous known concepts .
- Don't always study alone. Studying in groups helps a lot.
- Don't highlight text blindly. Highlighting doesn't help that much. It only indicates Recognition not Recollection of the topic. Besides, the highlight create a sense of "I have learnt it", but in fact , you just recognize it ,not understand it.
- Always take notes. And refill you notes just after you finish the class. Reviewing the notes after a short time helps a lot.
- Always try to teach others what you have learned. Teaching is the best way of learning. If you don't have a object to teach, just speak it loudly to an empty chair.
- Sleep is so much important for pushing something into your long-term memory. Get at least 7-8 hours of sound sleep.
- Use the SQ3R(survey, question, recite, read, review) method while studying. Especially when your exam is around the corner, this method will be an effective way to review the content you have just studied.
- Use Mnemonics. It's the best way to memorize facts.
